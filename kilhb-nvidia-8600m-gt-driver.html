Yes, I know it's a granddad card, but for a laptop from 2009 it does it's job well enough. I was hoping, actually, to use it as a lite steam machine, with Windows 7 32bit (more on that in a bit) and the registry edit for replacing Explorer with Big Picture. The issue I'm having is this: The only drivers I've found so far that make the gfx card work are ones from 2008 (urk!) on MSI's (laptop manufacturer) website. That should be good enough, except that big picture has some serious graphical.

The 8800 series, codenamed G80, was launched on November 8, 2006 with the release of the GeForce 8800 GTX and GTS for the high-end market. A 320 MB GTS was released on February 12 and the Ultra was released I was "disconnected" from AMD vs Nvidia Linux drama. I m honestly asking, not flaming. My personal experience with NVIDIA was perfect. Never had any problem with their binary drivers, but my friends with AMD cards would constantly run in all sorta weird shit bugs and so on that was like 5 years ago many horror stories. I actually would love to get AMD card, but dont want to get fucked after newer cards comes and support is kinda dropped. And all sorta shit starts to happen

Технические характеристики видеокарты NVIDIA GeForce 9600M Recently installed linux mint 18 on my old Dell XPS m1530 (https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-xps-m1530/specs/) laptop. Absolutely loving it so far, but I've been noticing that its getting really hot. Is there a way to check how fast is the fan running or if its running at all? And can I control it? Installed the Nvidia driver for the inbuilt 8600m GT graphics card over the default intel graphics card. Could this be an issue.

Hey all, your advice would be greatly appreciated. I can't afford a new computer/laptop for a while (at least a year) so I'm trying to figure out short term solutions that will help me be able to continue to play some of these more robust FTB modpacks (new DireWolf20, Monster, Horizons, etc.) at a decent FPS. I'd be playing on hosted servers rather then running it all off my machine which should help. It would also be with low stress visual config settings in place - Normal View Distance. 
Don’t forget to enable Windows Aero once your computer has booted up. Please note despite Nvidia’s claim that the Sony VAIO support will be added in a later release, you can use the modded INF with the Notebook GeForce Driver on your Sony VAIO laptop making use of Windows. I loved my PC before the GPU gave out - it was top of the line when new - more RAM, more HDD space, excellent screen, etc - they Dell don't make them like they used to (no Dell laptop, other than the XPS series, is really worth it anymore in my opinion). My PC is still decent, but my wrecked GPU probably puts me in the low-mid area of this group. I'm just curious, how many other people have had a GPU burn out on them, and how many of you have had the manufacturer respond in any way (other.

I have wanted to use arch for a long time, and today I finally installed it. I have installed `lxde` , `xorg-xinit` and `xorg-server`, but when I run `startx` it says xinit: giving up xinit: unable to connect to X server: Connection refused xinit: server error Below is my complete Xorg.0.log file: 4938.097 X.Org X Server 1.16.2 Release Date: 2014-11-10 4938.097 X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0 4938.097 Build Operating System: Linux 3.17.2-1. Edit: I think I've fixed this. I installed Linux Mint to see if the problem existed there too. It did. For whatever reason the recommended driver does not work when booking in EFI, nvidia-331 and nvidia-304 both failed, but nvidia-173 allowed X server to start. Not sure what the reason is, but there you go. Just putting this solution here in case someone ever reads this later.

Hello, I'm fairely new to Linux, because I want to get away from this damned Windows. So far I'm pretty happy with it, but I have one quite annoying issue that I cannot find anything about on the internet. When hibernating (suspend-to-disk) or supending (suspend-to-ram) my computer and resuming it, I will only see the log-in background without the password prompt and the time displayed in the background is stuck. I cannot do anything on the computer (opening another tty doesn't work as well). 
Hello, I have a programme that uses a significant number of big textures (most are 2048x1024, some are even 4096x2048). I can successfully generate mipmaps for them using either glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP, GL_TRUE) or glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D). The former is deprecated so I want to use the latter. If I use glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP, GL_TRUE), everything works fine, but if I use glGenerateMipmap, the whole programme becomes extremely sluggis. Im trying to install Windows 7 on my Macbook Pro that has Lion OSX. I have a Intel Core 2 Duo with 4g Ram. After partitioning my HD bootcamp tells me to insert the Windows CD. When I insert the CD it spins for a little bit makes some noise then ejects the CD. I check at the minimum requirements I believe my MBP fulfills all of it. Processor 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Memory 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM Software Mac OS X Lion 10.7 (11A511) Serial Number W87492HSXAH Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 8600M Its finally time Reddit, I'm finally fed up of Micro$oft dicking about with their OS enough that its time to drop it and flush. Now I am going to have to dual boot because there are just some things that Linux doesn't do as well (League of Legends being one), but I need some help picking what will become my MAIN OS because I want to boot into widows as little as possible. I have always gotten on with KDE much better than I have Gnome (no idea why), but that leaves me with a hard question: Kubunt. 
Hello /r/linux4noobs I've got a question. I've been trying to get Ubuntu or any linux distro on my mac book pro 3.1. It has a intel core 2 duo and 2 gb of ram. Also has a nvidia 8600m gt. When I install the drivers that are under additional drivers and when I reboot I see the ubuntu start up screen then black screen. Before installing any drivers I had to use nomodeset and i915.modeset=0 to get into the desktop. I have no idea how to get back past the black screen after installing drivers. SOLVED See comments I had a torrid time recently trying to install the correct Nvidia packages for Debian Jessie / Testing. It went down like this; Fresh install add non-free and contrib to my sources list. Use nvidia-detect to suggest a nvidia package. Install the suggested nvidia-driver package. Use nvidia-xconfig to write a config file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf Reboot as suggested. This resulted in a blinking cursor after startup. time to debug; Check /var/log/Xor. Hi all! Apologies if this is a stupid question -- google has been of little help past a certain point. I am trying to install Mint 16 onto a late-2007 macbook pro using a homemade bootable flash drive. I get as far as the main GRUB 2.0 splash menu and then when hitting go: black screen. Going through compatibility mode, the the output gets as far as 'conflicting fb hw usage nouveaufb vs EFI VGA - removing generic driver' before the installer stalls out. So, going into boot options I have a Sony Vaio notebook with an Nvidia Geforce 8600m GT GPU with the drivers it originally shipped with, Windows Server 2008 Standard (SP2), and an Intel Core 2 duo T9300 2.5ghz. Typically, Server 2008 counts as Vista when it comes to software, right? I downloaded the driver that is for Vista and supports my GPU, but when I try to install it, it says it cannot find compatible hardware. What am i supposed I recently got a Cintiq Companion Hybrid 13HD, which connects to computers using an HDMI signal. Both my computers use DVI-I outputs, so I had to buy an adapter to convert my computer's DVI signal to HDMI. However when plugging my Hybrid in it fails to enter what is called "Desktop Mode," which is what allows me to use it as a Cintiq instead of a mobile tablet, as it normally should. The computer still detects it as a display, with proper resolution, refresh rates, and identifications. I just started playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution but the game would always crash during the loading screen after a cutscene. An error would pop up: "A problem has occurred with your display driver. Your system may not have enough resources to run the game at the selected settings. You can retry using the same settings, or adjust them to lower settings. Make sure you have the latest drivers for your video hardware, and try rebooting your system to clear up any issues." The set up screen. I'm trying to get a friend into the game so we can play together but so far he hasn't been able to get it to run smoothly enough to play getting only around 10 FPS. In single player ARMA 2 he gets about 45 FPS, I'm not sure what I should be trying to change at this point. He plays on all lowest settings right now.

So I upgraded my sister's Sony laptop to Win 8 from Vista yesterday, and things are starting to go haywire. Prior to the install I ran the compatibility advisor and all things checked out. Hardware is as follows 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, 320GB HDD, an NVidia 8600M GT video card and Blu-ray drive. The hardware passed, all her software checked out and the install went smoothly. Once it was done, I was unable to play any Blu-ray discs (primary reason she bought the thing to begin with) I am attempting to run Ubuntu in OSX though VirtualBox due to my desire of a little toy penguin for my pyro. after installing ubuntu, I am prompted with "The system is running in low graphics mode, your screen, graphics card and input device settings could not be detected correctly. you will need to configure these yourself." after clicking ok, I get; run in low graphics mode - this restarts the screen and gives me the console login. after logging in, startx does nothing reconfigure graphics. Here is my system: NVIDIA Geforce 8600M GT with the suggested beta driver from Anet Core 2 Duo T8300 2.4GHz 50 GB space free 3GB ram WvW and sPvP are the worst, giving me about 3-5 fps usually and as low as 2 in the largest battles. Is anyone else getting performance like this with a similar machine? My graphics settings are on Best Performance. So I've had gnome 3 on arch linux, and it crashed occassionally without reason which was very annoying, while other desktop environments worked fine. I then got so fed up with it that I installed OpenSuse and hoped this would solve the problem. Again gnome 3 keeps crashing occassionally. I think the 'standard' graphics driver that gets installed for the Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT of my macbook pro is incompatible with gnome 3 or rather "gnome 3 is incompatible with that graphics driver".
