                            <p> Got questions about what its like to be a session drummer. Hey guys, I don't want to make the text box too long so I will post their answers as comments. Mark, Bruce, and Daniel Glass will all be teaching the Triple Threat Drum Camp ( in Woodland Hills, California from July 18-20. If you can't afford it, check out Modern Drummer's contest Oh my goodness, y'all, there's so much I want to do this week that I wish I was the X-Men mutant that can multiply himself. Per usual, if you know about an event I've missed, please feel free to share the details/link in the comments! Especially for things going on this week, I'd hate to have someone miss a thing they'd really enjoy because I wasn't logged in. If you have a future event, go ahead and PM me the info on that. I'll make sure it ends up here and on the www.dfwexplorer.com Hey friends, I was just wondering if any of you have attended masterclasses with any of your favorite drummers? What was the experience like? How much did you pay, and was it worth the price? Benny Greb has a Masterclass in Big Indian NY next year if anyone is interested in looking into it, if you're aware of any other classes, I'd be glad to hear about. Out of boredom, I decided to compile the engagement stats for the past few seasons of contestants from ninjalitics (excluding this current bachelor season since ERs aren't going to be stable). To be included are contestants that made it into the top 10 or BIP. Contestants with private accounts and disabled commenting are excluded. Becca's Season Garrett Yrigoyen: 4.20% Blake Horstmann: 11.51% Jason Tartick: 8.50% Colton Underwood: 10.57% Wills Reid: 5.21% Leo Dottavio: 2.07% Connor. Boras is moments away from hosting his famous annual meeting at the Winter Meetings where he almost certainly will make several 50/50 comments (noteworthy/cringeworthy) about the state of baseball, why the game is so unfair to him and his players, and why his clients are better than anyone else thinks they are. Instead of making separate posts for every quote here, I've decided this time around to just make one thread to contain them all as they come through. Stay tuned. --- It has begun:.
